## Sales Engine

For this Turing School project we wrote a data reporting tool that manipulates and reports on merchant transactional data.

###Project Goals

* Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
* Use test fixtures instead of actual data when testing
* Build a complex system of relationships using multiple interacting classes
* Demonstrate the DRY principle with modules and/or duck typing
* Separate parsing and data loading logic from business logic
* Use memoization to improve performance
